# Chapter 7 : Limits

## Level 4

The following three proofs should prove to be very useful in the level where you prove lim_mul.

This proof is very specific to that proof but the idea should be obvious in a general case.
The proof basically says that if you have a positive real number ε and divide it by
a positive real number, then the quotient is also positive. In this particular example,
the second positive real number is b which is multiplied by two for proving lim_mul.
